## My process

My current process is to look at the final product and map out the divisions and elements. I take that information and create the HTML. After that step, I move on to the CSS for desktop and then add a media query for mobile.

### Built with

- HTML
- Basic CSS
- Flexbox


### Continued development

I am new to website development, so I am hoping to get better at my workflow and general knowledge. I feel like this project required me to do a lot of little tweeks to values to make everything function, so it isn't as clean as it could be. I hope that as I learn more, I will figure out what are the best practices to follow. 

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Help](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me with flexbox. I am sure everyone already uses this website.
